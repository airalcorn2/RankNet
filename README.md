# RankNet and LambdaRank
My (slightly modified) Keras implementation of RankNet as described [here](http://icml.cc/2015/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/icml_ranking.pdf) and PyTorch implementation of LambdaRank as described [here](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2971-learning-to-rank-with-nonsmooth-cost-functions.pdf). See [here](https://github.com/airalcorn2/Solr-LTR) for a tutorial demonstating how to to train a model that can be used with Solr.
